# Crazy-Buttons-Android
The android client that will consume what will eventually be a RESTful API on the server side.
I started this app towards the end of my internship at IBM. I learned a lot from my time there, and had a lot of fun with networking!

This app is essentially meant to be a dead-simple idea that serves as a playground for various ideas that I'm having to play with the android system.
Right now, all it is is 3 buttons that change a counter on a server.

I am currently working on figuring out how to do user-tracking and figuring out how to secure my API so that I can make it so users have a customized experience where the app "remembers them" so to speak. A challenge will be my aversion to login screens/credentials. I plan to use a unique device ID that comes from the android device itself to "log a user in".

I also want to do some animations and maybe some custom views to give the app a great look and feel. This app is also partly about exploring UX and how to make an app satisfying to use. Such a simple idea can be made profound when it is presented in a stellar manner.
